 üìù Project Description  
The Useless Fact Generator is a playful web app that serves absurd AI-generated "facts" with matching visuals. Featuring a mischievous button that dodges clicks and quirky sound effects, it turns pointless information into comedic entertainment. Built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, it celebrates the joy of uselessness!


The Problem (That Doesn't Exist)  
"People aren't confused enough by fake information in their daily lives."

 The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)  
My website generates certifiably useless facts with AI images, because why should useful apps have all the fun?
